# Ian's Blog - CSP
I'm Ian, a current 10th grader, and this blog will go through my journey in CSP - All the struggles, successes, and failures that I go through in this class.

Latest Weekly Log: [Week-1-Log](_posts/2023-08-21-Week%201.md)

### Hobbies/About Me
Where I spend my time when I'm not overloaded with the truckton of homework I get
- Freeform image, about me: 
![Freeform-about-me](/images/csp_image_thing.png){width=35% height=35%}
The above represents my interests, namely geography and computers, as well as a love for road trips. Please excuse the terrible drawing skills, drawing is not my strong suite.

##### Geography Links
One of my passions is learning various things about geography, as there are many, many places to explore.
- City knowledge test: [Cityquiz](https://cityquiz.io)
- City coverage on a map: [Hugequiz](https://hugequiz.com/quizzes)
- [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)

### Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

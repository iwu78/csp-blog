## Day 1 - Monday - 8/28/23
> 
- Setup lab notebook
- Learned how to fix divergent branches error
    - If you edit a file on github, commiting will throw an error at you
    - Solution is in the long error message, is to specify what to do when the version on github is different from original
- Read Javascript Input article on teacher page

## Day 2 - Tuesday - 8/22/23
>
- Removed CSSE and CSA pages, kept CSP
- Finished updating lab notebook
- Managed to get a custom Jekyll theme with help of teacher
    - Follow instructions on theme readme
        - bundle install theme-name
        - add theme as dependency in gem file
        - set theme in _config.yml
        - remove head-custom line in head.html
        - errors take a long time to pop up, make will get stuck
            - go to /tmp/jekyll4200.log and cat file to view error
        - add any required background images, rename layouts if needed
        - header and other layouts may not show, need to copy from theme manually and update accordingly
        - if any other things fail to show up, compare source of your site to demo site usually provided by theme
        - add any html for titles or icons accordingly
        - icons may create an error since the path to the image from the _posts folder and from the _layouts folder is slightly different
            - links to posts are baseurl/year/month/day/title on website, so to reference an image in images folder ../../../images/image.png is required instead
            - my solution was to create a new layout named default-post, and have the post layour include that rather than the normal post
                - default-post layout includes a copy of header named header-post, which include the link to the icon image from a post, rather than from the homepage

## Day 3 - Wednesday - 8/23/23
>
- Added Snake Game
    - Messed around with CSS and JavaScript to better fit colors
        - Changed border color, menu highlight color, and background color
        - Changed food color and distinguished between food and snake color
            - Created new function to paint snake different color
    - Added option for two pieces of food by modifying existing code for more practice
        - Two food was simply an idea that popped into my head, and doing so would give me more practice
    - Added JS calculator
        - Debugged issue with wrong reference in header for calculator to correctly reference style.scss
        - Messed around with button CSS
            - Changed hover color, added multiple hover colors for clear and equals buttons
        - Made text float right using text-align and direction css
        - Added division and exponent operations
            - Option for division was already coded, had to add new case in switch for exponent
                - Thank god for w3schools or else I would not have figured out that Math.pow is the way to do exponents and not the carat (^), which is an XOR operation in coding.
            - Imported custom background javaScript files, they look very cool.

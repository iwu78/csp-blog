## Day 1 - Monday - 8/28/23
> 
- Setup lab notebook
- Learned how to fix divergent branches error
    - If you edit a file on github, commiting will throw an error at you
    - Solution is in the long error message, is to specify what to do when the version on github is different from original
- Read Javascript Input article on teacher page

## Day 2 - Tuesday - 8/22/23
>
- Removed CSSE and CSA pages, kept CSP
- Finished updating lab notebook
- Managed to get a custom Jekyll theme with help of teacher
    - Follow instructions on theme readme
        - bundle install theme-name
        - add theme as dependency in gem file
        - set theme in _config.yml
        - remove head-custom line in head.html
        - errors take a long time to pop up, make will get stuck
            - go to /tmp/jekyll4200.log and cat file to view error
        - add any required background images, rename layouts if needed
        - header and other layouts may not show, need to copy from theme manually and update accordingly
        - if any other things fail to show up, compare source of your site to demo site usually provided by theme
        - add any html for titles or icons accordingly
        - icons may create an error since the path to the image from the _posts folder and from the _layouts folder is slightly different
            - links to posts are baseurl/year/month/day/title on website, so to reference an image in images folder ../../../images/image.png is required instead
            - my solution was to create a new layout named default-post, and have the post layour include that rather than the normal post
                - default-post layout includes a copy of header named header-post, which include the link to the icon image from a post, rather than from the homepage

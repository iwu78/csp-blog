Random Sort
<br>
Time Complexity: O(n!)
<br>
Pros:
<br>
 - nonexistent
Cons:
<br>
 - loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to sort

Insertion Sort
<br>
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)<br>
Best Case Time Complexity: O(1)<br>
Process:<br>
 - Insertion sort begins by sorting a small section of the array, known as the sorted subsection
 - Then, each element is compared one-by-one with the sorted subsection until its correct place is found
 - This is repeated, until at the end when a check is performed and the sort is complete
<br>
Pros:
 - Simple, easy to implement
 - Already in use in daily lives in many ways
<br>
Cons:
 - Slow, unpractical, as large number of comparisons makes it impractical at times

Quick Sort<br>
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)<br>
Process:<br>
 - Pivot element is selected, element in middle of list
 - Elements are compared to pivot and moved to proper side of arraw
 - New pivot is selected, and process is repeated until array is sorted<br>
Pros:
 - Quick, efficient sorting<br>
Cons:
 - More complicated to implement comparatively to some other algorithms<br>

Bubble Sort<br>
Best Case Time Complexity: O(n)<br>
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)<br>
Process:
 - Compare two adjacent elements, and swap them accordingly
 - Move down an element, repeat
 - Repeat by starting over again until line is sorted<br>
Pros:
 - Simple to implement<br>
Cons:
 - Slow, especially if elements are far out of place<br>

Merge Sort<br>
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)<br>
Process:
- Split list into two halves
- Split halves into more halves
- Repeat until left with groups of two
- Sort groups of two
- Sort groups of four
- Repeat and merge groups until list is sorted<br>
Pros:
 - Quick, efficient sorting<br>
Cons:
 - Complicated comparatively to some algorithms, i.e. selection sort, bubble sort, etc<br>

Selection Sort<br>
Time Complexity: O(n^2)<br>
Process: 
 - Iterate through list and find lowest element
 - Swap lowest element with first element in list
 - Iterate through rest of list and find second lowest element
 - Swap this with second element in list
 - Repeat until list is sorted<br>
Pros:
 - Simple, easy to implement<br>
Cons:
 - Slow at times, depends on location of shorter and longer elements (i.e. partially sorted)<br>

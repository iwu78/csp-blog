Random Sort
Time Complexity: O(n!)
Pros:
 - nonexistent
Cons:
 - loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to sort

Insertion Sort
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Best Case Time Complexity: O(1)
Process:
 - Insertion sort begins by sorting a small section of the array, known as the sorted subsection
 - Then, each element is compared one-by-one with the sorted subsection until its correct place is found
 - This is repeated, until at the end when a check is performed and the sort is complete
Pros:
 - Simple, easy to implement
 - Already in use in daily lives in many ways
Cons:
 - Slow, unpractical, as large number of comparisons makes it impractical at times

Quick Sort
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Process:
 - Pivot element is selected, element in middle of list
 - Elements are compared to pivot and moved to proper side of arraw
 - New pivot is selected, and process is repeated until array is sorted
Pros:
 - Quick, efficient sorting
Cons:
 - More complicated to implement comparatively to some other algorithms

Bubble Sort
Best Case Time Complexity: O(n)
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Process:
 - Compare two adjacent elements, and swap them accordingly
 - Move down an element, repeat
 - Repeat by starting over again until line is sorted
Pros:
 - Simple to implement
Cons:
 - Slow, especially if elements are far out of place

Merge Sort
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Process:
- Split list into two halves
- Split halves into more halves
- Repeat until left with groups of two
- Sort groups of two
- Sort groups of four
- Repeat and merge groups until list is sorted
Pros:
 - Quick, efficient sorting
Cons:
 - Complicated comparatively to some algorithms, i.e. selection sort, bubble sort, etc

Selection Sort
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Process: 
 - Iterate through list and find lowest element
 - Swap lowest element with first element in list
 - Iterate through rest of list and find second lowest element
 - Swap this with second element in list
 - Repeat until list is sorted
Pros:
 - Simple, easy to implement
Cons:
 - Slow at times, depends on location of shorter and longer elements (i.e. partially sorted)

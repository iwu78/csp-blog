CPT Project Feature:
 - Button Animation given user input, canvas is displayed and user can draw lines
 - Stores positions and creates a keyframe animation based upon positions
 - Animation is applied to button
 - Worked on backend CRUD for designs, allows request to update, create, and read from design database

Next Steps:
 - Clearer way to store animations on backend
 - Would require a second column as keyframes are appended and cannot be done inline

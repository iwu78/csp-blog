## Idea
The idea to do image manipulation came with the teacher's example passion project of demonstrating specific hex values in images. Our first idea was to match an emoji to a user uploaded image, but after doing research and asking around, we ultimately thought that the idea to do so was extremely ambitious and decided that we should at least implement some basic functions first.
